## Hi,

I'm Yves Bennaïm, based in Geneva, Switzerland. -- Online since 1992, I have been an [Online Branding][0] Specialist and [Web Strategy][1] Consultant, and I helped people make the Net work for their business. -- In the last twenty years, I spent most of my time in Tokyo, Paris, Brisbane, and Shanghai, usually in front of a computer screen. -- Now I am back to healthier and more traditional values, thanks to [TOKYONAMA][2], importer, retailer, and distributer of original products from Japan, and [SANSUI][3], Geneva's authentic Japanese restaurant and izakaya.
