## Hi,

I'm Yves Bennaïm, based in Geneva, Switzerland.

Online since 1992, I have been an Online Branding Specialist and Web Strategy Consultant, and I helped people make the Net work for their business.

In the last twenty years, I spent most of my time in Tokyo, Paris, Brisbane, and Shanghai, usually in front of a computer screen.

Now I am back to healthier and more traditional values, thanks to TOKYONAMA, importer, retailer, and distributer of original products from Japan, and SANSUI, Geneva's authentic Japanese restaurant and izakaya.
